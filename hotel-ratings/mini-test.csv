We needed an early wakeup call, but couldn't use the clock radio alarm as there wasn't a radio in the room.

We were told by the staff that at a certain temperature outside the air would not turn on and the heater would go on automatically.

The hotel is beautiful, very modern, stylish, with attention to detail. Our room on the -th floor was spacious, with great decor, hardwood floors, Keurig coffee maker, and floor to ceiling windows.
The bathroom was also big with a large shower. There was no tub, which was fine with us.
One of the best things - a QUIET air-conditioner! Finally something that didn't wake me up at night. Overall, the room was very quite despite the fact that there were occupied rooms all around us.
The staff was very pleasant. We asked if we could have a late check out at - pm. The gentleman at the desk graciously offered us - pm checkout due to our platinum status. It was perfect!
The restaurant downstairs in the lobby was nice, but doesn't really have much selection for lunch. The upstairs patio bar on the -th floor was closed for renovation.
The location is great. Within walking distance to Balboa Park (you can grab a free trolley once in the park), Seaport Village and of course Gaslamp.

I had a room on the --th floor. It was spooky. The --th floor is only half a floor, rooms on one side of the hall, the other side of the hall is roof. The hallway temperature was in the mid --'s. The building moaned with mechanical sounds coming, seemingly, from everywhere. More than once I was reminded of the movie Barton Fink.

We had a room with a king bed, there was - of us, so I asked for a rollaway bed, $--- night.

What I considered a ripoff however was the $--- day we had to pay for internet, when these days most places now offer it for free. Not only that, but it was only good for one device! We had two laptops, so only one could access the internet on any given day.
They say the room comes with DVD player, well you have to ask for one, because they are not in the room. Also, the tvs are very old. I asked for a DVD player - different days before I got one, they have a limited number. There is no ice machine, and the vending machines are only on the ground floor.

Thankfully I woke up on my own because they never called. So again I don't know if we were treated poorly because we were in a discounted room, or that's just the way they are.

We had to go and buy some soap-shampoo at the local convience store. The towels were very rough, like sandpaper. Gross. Our room, which was reserved was not available, we had to take - doubles and the unslightly mold in the shower was an eye sore, the air conditoner was really loud, luckily it drowned out anyone sharing the wall with us and on our way out we saw what appeared to be a pimp yelling at his 'working-girl' while she cried. Nice eh? I would reccomend this place if you are not picky and want to save some money. Just bring your own soap!",Firefox,Desktop
id80179,"This is definitely a - star hotel. Luxury the minute you walk into the hotel. Staff were attentive and the rooms were very large and comfortable. After some research on Tripadvisor i had high expectations for this property and i was not disappointed. Only thing disappointing was that we did not spend a lot of time in the hotel. We had a - bedroom apartment and it was beautifully appointed with good size rooms, proper kitchen and laundry which was great, especially as we had been traveling in Hawaii for a week prior to SF and was then heading off to Ski Fields. 
The apartment was very clean and well looked after. 
Good location if your wanting to do the Tourist things near Fishermans Wharf. Take a tour of Alcatraz, the concierge got us tickets for the tour. If your wanting to do shopping then Union Square is the place to go. We took a taxi, the hotel has one courtesty car, however was not available for when we needed it, so we took a taxi for $-- each way. 
Breakfast was great, however for the price of the hotel, you would expect a full hot breakfast, the breakfast provided was continental, i did enjoy the fresh raspberries and blueberries on offer. 
I would recommend this hotel, it is a - star property and you would expect to pay for this.",Google Chrome,Mobile
id80180,"We were with a large group of -- on on our way to my sons baseball tournament. There were -- of us and we arrived at - am to check in, after taking a red eye from Califonia. Most of the people in our group were children. The staff welcomed us (Thank you Gio) allowed us to eat breakfast and crash in the lobby until our rooms were ready. They got all of us in quickly and when our suite wasn't ready they gave us two standard rooms so we would have plenty of room for our family to be comfortable, at no extra charge. The location was great, right across from the Garden home of the Bruins, and we were there when they won the Stanley cup. Even though the game was in Canada the area was packed with excitment. We were excited to be a part of it all and became Bruins fans!
The Boston police did an excellent job of keeping everything under control. The hotel did an excellent job of handling the extra traffic and chaos too. The manger, Jamie, was very nice and gave ice cream and candy treats to the kids. The area did not seem bad to me at all. There are a lot of pubs in the area, but there seem to be alot of pubs all over Boston. We were with in walking distance of many areas of attraction and we were able to purchase our tour bus tickets at the front desk and catch the bus across the street. The rooms were nothing fancy, but every one in our group agreed that this was a great experience and we would stay here again.",InternetExplorer,Mobile
