Here is my Text Prompt: 
<ol>
  <li>Hi, I am going on a trip, here is my plan: 7/2 from LAX to Bellevue, WA. 7/3 Seattle Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and Gum Wall. 7/4 Visit Friends in Bellevue, 7/5 visit University of Washington. I am leaving to travel elsewhere on 7/6, can you search up hotels nearby for each day of my travel and put together an itinerary for my hotels and travel planï¼Ÿ</li>
 <li>Could you list the suggested hotel for each day? Why you would suggest them, also give me a review from 1-5 and the reason. </li>

## Findings
<ol>
  <li>ChatGPT may not get everything correct, user must remind ChatGPT for misunderstanding and miscommunication</li>
  <li>Input format is important, I find that text > pdf > image, with text being the most accurate reading, and image get misinterpreted the most. Since ChatGPT is a LLM, clarity of language is preferred.</li>
  <li>Could breakdown tasks to ask ChatGPT, and ask ChatGPT to join answers together to make complete answer. </li>
  <li>Give feedback on ChatGPT's response, yes or no, what is missing, and give personal preference for ChatGPT to choose.</li>
  <li>ChatGPT will give smaller answer based on the latest user prompt, user need to indicate format the completeness of response.</li>
  <li>Very Expensive to do on the API</li>
</ol>
