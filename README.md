# ChatGPT
<p>ChatGPT by OpenAI is artificial intelligence chatbot based on the company’s generative pre-trained transformer series of large language models (LLMs); </p>
<p>Generating AI: from analyzing existing data to creating new things. The goal is to bring down the marginal cost of creation and knowledge work. Faster and more efficient to the workers, or threatening? The AI became bigger and bigger, even surpassing human performance benchmark. Expensive to use as a cloud service. As computers get cheaper, AI began to bloom from now on, we will be expecting killer apps to emerge. Text, Code, Images to Video/3D/Gaming AI. </p>
<p>GPT-3:  Lack of logical reasoning, intentions, goals, and ability to understand cause and effect. Tend to be racist because of the tendency from data gathered.</p>
  <ul>-	Currently a Freemium business mode. Free GPT-3.5, and $20/month GPT-    4.</ul>
  <ul>-	Scale fast, too many users overflowing the website. </ul>
  <ul>-	Many usages for different areas but based on information before 2021. 
    <ul>•	Avoid law and finding articles because it makes up responses. </ul>
    <ul>•	Able to write and debug computer programs, compose music, teleplays, fairy tales and student essays, answer test questions, generate business ideas, write poetry and song lyrics, translate and summarize text.</ul>
</ul>

  <ul>-	Biased towards left-leaning perspectives.</ul>

<p>Experience of Using ChatGPT to write codes and projects:</p>
<ul>Cons:
  <ul>-	Not every answer given is workable, sometimes when a better solution   for one part is proposed, the code does not work. </ul>
  <ul>-	Need to manually add code sometimes. </ul>
  <ul>-	When given big chunks of code, it might mess up and will take a long time to debug it. </ul>
  <ul>-	The responses are not creative and too general.</ul>
</ul>
<ul>Pros:
  <ul>-	Sets up the structure, easy to use, have a simple working demo easily and fast.</ul>
  <ul>-	It is very good for looking up syntaxes if I forget any and give relatively good example code in the project context.  </ul>
  <ul>-	Able to remember the previous conversation and correct codes based on user input and previous code. </ul>
  <ul>-	Can give explanation/comment on the codes. </ul>
</ul>

<p>Using ChatGPT for Exam questions: </p>
<ul>Input test study guide:
<ul>-	Give definition and examples of the concept asked, very accurate. </ul></ul>
<ul>Givenn Exam Questions:
  <ul>-	Give a set of vague answers but does not seem to answer the prompt correctly, “sometimes writes plausible sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers".</ul>  
  <ul>-	GPT 4 gives a more accurate answer than GPT 3.</ul>
  <ul>-	Answers are what is generally available online.</ul>
</ul>
<p>Inputting personal data into OpenAI ChatGPT:</p>
<ul>-	Gives answer from my data that I fed in, easy to look up information.</ul>
<ul>-	Potential data leak, especially important information like security questions and passwords. </ul>
<ul>-	Depending on the keywords, it can find out my name even though I did not explicitly put “name” in the data. </ul>
<ul>-	Still in 2020/2021, because I put birth year, and ChatGPT’s answer to my age is 3 years younger. </ul>
<ul>-	Able to retrieve information from personal data and big LLM</ul>

<p>UI/UX:</p>
<ul>-	Clear layout of chats histories in 30 Days, and current chat. </ul>
<ul>-	Black and white design, simplicity, comfortable to look at.</ul>
<ul>-	Responses are given as texting, not as a whole block, which looks like ChatGPT is thinking and a person is responding to me. </ul>
<ul>-	Instructions at the start of page: Examples, Capabilities, Limitations.</ul>
<ul>-	Options to share chat, saved chat to account.   </ul>
